* Changes

** 2.0 (2020-XX-XX)

+ Added truecolor (24-bit) and overlay support.
  Thanks to Dan Davison for initial implementation.

+ More robust parsing. Errors are no longer signaled to avoid
  desynchronizing the state machine. Unsupported SGR sequences that
  happen to overlap with supported ones are skipped.

+ Minor documentation fixes and style updates.
