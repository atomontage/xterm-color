* Changes

** 2.0 (2020-05-10)

+ Added truecolor (24-bit) and overlay support. Overlays may optionally
  be used only when colorizing entire buffers. Thanks to Dan Davison
  for initial implementation.

+ More robust parsing. Errors are no longer signaled to avoid
  desynchronizing the state machine. Unsupported SGR sequences that
  happen to overlap with supported ones are skipped.

+ Minor documentation fixes and style updates.
