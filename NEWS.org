* Changes

** 2.0 (2020-05-10)

+ Added truecolor (24-bit) and overlay support. Overlays may optionally
  be used only when colorizing entire buffers. Thanks to Dan Davison
  for initial implementation.

+ Better parsing and malformed input detection. Errors are no longer
  signaled to avoid desynchronizing the state machine. Unsupported SGR
  sequences that happen to overlap with supported ones are skipped.

+ Added `xterm-color-render' (default: t) that can be used to filter out
  ANSI control sequences without applying them to the text.

+ Minor documentation fixes and style updates.
