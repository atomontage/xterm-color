xterm-color.el is an ANSI control sequence to text-property translator

* Features
- Regular ANSI color support
- XTERM 256 color support
- Bonus: Faster than ansi-color.el

* Usage 
Call xterm-color-filter to propertize strings that you can then insert into
a buffer. All state is kept in buffer-local variables which means that
control sequences can span /xterm-color-filter/ call boundaries.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(xterm-color-filter "[0;1;3;4")
(xterm-color-filter ";35")
(xterm-color-filter ";mThis is only a test")
(xterm-color-filter "[0m")
#+END_SRC

If you are inserting into a buffer that has activated font locking, you need
to set /font-lock-unfontify-region-function/ to /xterm-color-unfontify-region/

You can replace ansi-color.el with xterm-color for all comint buffers:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; Use xterm-color-unfontify-region-23 on Emacs 23.x

;; comint install
(progn (add-hook 'comint-preoutput-filter-functions 'xterm-color-filter)
       (setq comint-output-filter-functions (remove 'ansi-color-process-output comint-output-filter-functions))
       (setq font-lock-unfontify-region-function 'xterm-color-unfontify-region))

;; comint uninstall
(progn (remove-hook 'comint-preoutput-filter-functions 'xterm-color-filter)
       (add-to-list 'comint-output-filter-functions 'ansi-color-process-output)
       (setq font-lock-unfontify-region-function 'font-lock-default-unfontify-region))

;; Also set TERM accordingly (xterm-256color)

;; You can also use it with eshell (and thus get color output from system ls):

(require 'eshell)

(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq xterm-color-preserve-properties t)))

(add-to-list 'eshell-preoutput-filter-functions 'xterm-color-filter)
(setq eshell-output-filter-functions (remove 'eshell-handle-ansi-color eshell-output-filter-functions))

;;  Don't forget to setenv TERM xterm-256color

#+END_SRC

* Test
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x xterm-color-test

For comint or eshell:

M-x shell || M-x eshell

perl tests/xterm-colortest && perl tests/256colors2.pl

#+END_SRC
